%	RESUME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Resume}
\cvitem{}{During my education I have been focusing on quantum optics and experimental physics, which has made me develop substantial analytical, programming and statistical skills. I have handled and processed large amounts of data, therefore memory and run-time optimization as well as statistical analysis of data come natural to me. To challenge myself, during my master's project, I decided to do all the scripting in Python, but I still have a lot of experience with Matlab, which I have taught to students at university.}

\cvitem{Supervisors}{Professor Eugene Polzik \& Associate Professor Albert Schliesser}
\cvitem{Description}{An experiment trying, via optomechanical effects, to laser cool a nano-membrane to its ground state. The nano-membrane motion is caused by Brownian motion due to its finite temperature. It is exactly this vibrational noise we cooled away to glance at a macroscopic objects quantum behavior. The membrane was laser cooled from cryogenic temperature (4 K) down to 3 mK, yielding a 4\% chance of observing the object in its ground state.}

\textbf{Physicist seeking job as Growth Hacker}
\\~\\
I am very excited to be submitting you my application, because the position as growth hacker sounds just right for me, since I get a kick out of reducing complex data into understandable results. The possibility of using data analysis to improve your company and product is really something I find extremely interesting.
\\~\\
I have recently finished my master's degree in physics with the grade 12 and are now looking to broaden my horizon. Programming and statistics are the two disciplines I enjoy the most besides quantum optics. During my studies I took the course Applied statistics, where one have to utilize skills in programming (C++) and statistics and I was very good at it. As part of running an optics laboratory it is necessary to obtain good programming skills for analyzing collected data quickly and using different statistical tools for validating the results. Data is never clean and often contain noise or mistakes, I enjoy being the detective troubleshooting for errors. I am rather efficient in Python and Matlab, where I have taught new students the latter.
\\~\\
Throughout my studies, I have worked on multiple projects. Especially my bachelor's and master's project are worth mentioning, during these projects I had to be efficient during laboratory hours, communicate and work with the international staff in my group while competing with the big leading researching groups in USA, so teamwork and communicating in English is natural to me. I do also enjoy delving into projects on my own and I am good at prioritizing and structuring my time.
\\~\\
I have good IT and programming skills and it is something I enjoy during my spare time as well. I am comfortable in all the major operating systems Mac OSX, Linux and Windows, but my daily routine is done in Mac OSX and Linux. If I could, I would spent all my time in the *NIX command line, where I am very efficient.
\\~\\
My former co-workers would describe me as helpful, hardworking, thorough and a quick learner, so I will quickly become efficient in new presented systems.
\\~\\
I hope that you have found this application exciting and want to learn more at a clarifying interview. I am looking forward hearing from you.
